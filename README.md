# Keypad-Lights
This is a project that I am Working on that is meant to be simulated neon lights under and inside my car. It is meant to be bass reactive and take inputs from the keypad to send data to ws2812 RGB LEDs. 

LightAndButtonC1.ino is the current project. April-25-2020
This was an update/combination of BasicKeypadLightsEventBased.ino and getkey_routine.ino
